# Node Kendo UI Sample Project #

It is a sample project for a Node/HTML5 application optimized separately for desktop browsers (web), iOS and Android devices. Its server side project is based on [robrighter / node-boilerplate](https://github.com/robrighter/node-boilerplate) and its client side project implements [ccoenraets / backbone-directory](https://github.com/ccoenraets/backbone-directory) sample using Kendo UI.

## Goals ##
1. Quickly get started with a Node/Kendo UI application
2. Optimize separately for browsers, phones and tablets
3. Serve pages optimized for the client automatically using the user agent string
4. Serve assets compressed in production but uncompressed during development
5. Chat capability (enabled on browsers)
6. BDD tests
7. Easily deployable on a Joyent Node SmartMachine
